# ENTRI

This repository, Entri Projects, contains all the projects, assignments, and exercises I’ve completed while learning through the Entri course.
It showcases my progress in Data Analytics, Python programming, MySQL, Excel, and other related tools and concepts.

Each folder includes hands-on tasks, real-world datasets, and problem-solving exercises that reflect the practical skills I’ve gained throughout the course
